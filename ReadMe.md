# Push swap

Project in *42 School*.

Main goal of this project is to sort numbers using 2 *stacks* and
*specific operations*.

There are two programs
* **Push Swap** - takes integer numbers in *arguments* and generates operations to sort them
using two stacks named 'a', 'b' respectively. At the start all integers passed as arguments is written
in stack 'a'.
* **Checker** - takes commands generated by push_swap into *stdin*, numbers to apply this
operations on in *arguments*, and checks if this commands will sort this numbers. If yes - displays *OK*,
if no - displays *KO*. In case of error - displays *Error*.

### Prerequisites

* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

### Installing

Run
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/oevtushe/push_swap.git && cd push_swap && make
```

### Commands to operate stacks
  * *pa* - push from 'a' to 'b'
  * *pb* - push from 'b' to 'a'
  * *sa* - swap top 2 elements in 'a'
  * *sb* - swap top 2 elements in 'b'
  * *ss* - swap top 2 elements in both stacks
  * *ra* - rotates stack 'a' (the first element becomes the last one)
  * *rb* - rotates stack 'b'
  * *rr* - rotates both stacks
  * *rra* - reverse rotates stack 'a' (the last element becomes the first one)
  * *rrb* - reverse rotates stack 'b'
  * *rrr* - reverse rotates both stacks
 
 ### Checker options
    -c - colored printing both stacks, you can see
          what is going on with stacks after every
          command executed.
    -d - execute commands in the real time, you
          type the command, checker execute it and
          prints the stacks.
    -fd <filename> - force checker to read commands from
                       file except stdin.
    --pretty='<pretty string>' - changes the view of stacks,
                                 run ./checker --pretty='' to see format.
    -s - prints statistics of operations executed (sum of all operations executed,
           and number of executions for each operation)
           
 ### Push_swap options
    -fd <filename> - writes commands in file.
    
 ### Ways to run
 ```
    1. ARG='<random numbers>; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
    2. ARG='<random numbers>; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker -c $ARG
    3. ARG='<random numbers>; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker -s $ARG
    4. ARG='<random numbers>; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker --pretty='^_^:: ^ ' $ARG
 ```
